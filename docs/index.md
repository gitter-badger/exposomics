We want to make it easier for everyone to generate their **-exposome-** their entire life's exposure from **air quality, water contamination and other environmental pressures** in minutes.
This is a huge endeavor with a massive opportunity to **understand factors that contribute to diseases and deteriorate our health. _Today we are asking developers and scientists to help build the pieces and debug the code._**

We’re inviting the community to design microapps and write extensions to the [doc.ai](https://doc.ai/) exposomic module. Along with great prizes in $NRN (Neuron Tokens) the best extensions will be integrated into the [doc.ai](https://doc.ai/) solution that performs deep learning computations to improve health outcomes and accelerate scientific research.

**Make your mark, it's happening now**

### [CHECKOUT OUR LIVE DEMO](https://exposomics.doc.ai)

The challenge is hosted on [doc.ai](https://doc.ai/) Exposomic repository. The goal of this challenge is to design a microapp and write extensions to the [doc.ai](https://doc.ai/) exposomic module. The best extensions will be integrated into doc ai solution that performs DL computations on all other quantified biology to improve health and accelerate scientific research.
