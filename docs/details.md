# Contest Details

## How to participate
* Create and submit a new issue, following the template we've provided. This includes listing all names, github accounts, and emails of everyone contributing to your project, and a brief (~1-2 paragraph) description of your proposed work.
* Fork the [repository](https://github.com/doc-ai/exposomics) and create your branch from `master`.
* Complete local installation instructions.
* Submit a pull request with a reference to your issue number (#IssueNumber), so your PR links directly to your issue submission.
* Upon a successful testing and code review, we will merge your branch into `master` and evaulate your entry for contest awards.

## Sample ideas for the Exposomic module
* For this challenge, you will write extensions to the doc.ai Exposomics module. An example file is provided in the doc.ai repository. Some ideas include:
* Gathering and cleaning other sources of location-based data
* Gathering and cleaning exposomic data outside of the U.S.
* Creating visualizations for other exposomes (e.g. water pollutants, other air pollutants) both inside and outside of US

## Challenge Entry Specifications
* A valid entry consists of a (final) pull request that produces a significant, fully functioning update to our webapp.
* Your code should be well documented - this is an open source project!
* *You CANNOT save any user information entered into the Exposomics module, especially location data entered by the user.*
